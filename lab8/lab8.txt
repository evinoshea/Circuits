intro:
This lab focused on working with digital ciurcuits. The two digital compontents used were the 555 timer and the nand gate. 

The goal of the first part of the lab was to demonstrate how nand gates work and how they can be used in various ways to create more interesting opertations by combining nand gates. 
the second part of the lab focusxed on the 555 timer. for this part of the lab, they design of the circuit would give a visual queue depending on the output of the 555 timer to demonstrate what the outputwas.


BG/theory 
Digital circuits consist of different high square pulses that can be catagorized as one of two states: high or low; 1 or 0. This type of circuitry is used in a lot of technology because it can send encoded data without error. The error is reduced, because a low andf high pulse can be easily distinguisehed even if there is noise in the signal. THis means that the data is only limited by the number of pulses sent.

In the lab, the gropup used LED's to get a visual feedback on the output of the circuit. 
LED's require a minimum voltage across them to light up. THis is perfect for digital circuits as the high voltage is over the diode voltage and the low is below it. This means that the LED on is a high coming through and the LED off is as low comming through.
