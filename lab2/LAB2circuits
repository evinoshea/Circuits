Intro:
The goal of Part 1 of the lab was to make current and voltage measurements of different circuit elements in order to characterize their current-voltage relationships. After taking measurements, the current and voltage can be plotted and fit to a curve. This will characterize the current-voltage relationship and will give the resistance of the elements.

The goal of Part 2 of the lab was to construct an R-2R ladder of resistors. The lab was designed to measure the equivalent resistance of the circuit through current and voltage measurements. Finding the equivalent resistance of the ladder as it is built will show how the ladder functions.

Methodology:
For the first part of the lab, the group had to construct a circuit which would test the current-voltage relationships of various passive circuit components. The way this was done was by setting up a circuit in which a battery with adjustable voltage was connected to a resistor.@@@@@@@ This effectively weakened the battery voltage supplied to the@@@@@@@@@ Then, the circuit was designed so that the element could be placed in series with the resistor. Then a voltmeter was set up in parallel with the circuit element to measure the voltage drop across the element. Lastly, an ameter was connected in series with the battery to measure the total current of the circuit. Since the voltmeter has such a high resistance compared to the elements being used, it does not affect the current flow in the circuit. The current flow that is measured by the ameter will be equal to the current flow through the elements used in the circuit. These measurements will be plotted to give the current-voltage relationships of the different circuit elements. 

For the second part of the lab, the group simply had to build an R-2R ladder and measure the equivalent resistance of the circuit as is was built. This was done by building the ladder in steps. The group only had 10k$\Omega$ resistors, which will be refered to as R in this section. To make 2R resistors, the group simply connected two 10k$\Omega$ resistors in series. The first step in building the circuit was to set up the voltmeter and ameter that would make the measurements of the circuit. The voltmeter was connected to the battery and was in parallel with the rest of the circuit at all times. This meant that the voltage of the battery would be measured by the voltmeter at all times. Since the voltmeter is well designed, this will not affect the resistance of the cicuit as a whole. An amater was set up in series between the ladder and the battery so that the total current of the circuit could be measured. These current and voltage measurments could be used with a form of Ohm's law to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit as shown below:

\begin{equation}
$V = IR \implies R = \frac{V}{I}$
\end{equation}

Next, the circuit was built in parts and the measurments were recorded as the parts were built. The first part built was made with just a 2R resistor. This would have a resistance of simply 2R or 20k$\Omega$. This circuit is shown below:

The ladder was then extended by adding a 2R resistor in parallel with the initial 2R resistor and a single R resistor added in series with the two 2R resistors that were in parallel. This circuit is shown below:

FIGURE

The equivalent resistance can be calculated by knowing that resistors in series add together and the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel are given by the equation:
\begin{equation}
$R_{parallel} = (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2})^{-1}$
\end{equation}

The equaivalent resistance of this circuit would be calculated first by finding the resistance of the two 2R resistors in parallel:
$R_{parallel} = (\frac{1}{2R}+\frac{1}{2R})^{-1} = R$
and then adding this resistance to the single R resitor in series. The equivalent resistance of this piece of the ladder would simply be $R_{eq} = 2R$. 

The group now just needed to repeat the last step of adding a 2R resistor in parallel with the part of the ladder that had already been created and addi groupng a single R resistor in series with that. The
